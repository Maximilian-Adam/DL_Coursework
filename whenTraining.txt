Use early stopping callback (set restore best weights to true)
save model weights and config for computed models
learning rate scheduler (type of callback)
reduce lr on plateau (type of callback) (evaluated on val loss for example)
Data normalisation (make sure to remember to save the normalisation and apply it also to the test data to ensure correctness (use adapt or whatever is best to apply normalisation))
Data augmentation (dependant on application, being careful not to overdo it)
